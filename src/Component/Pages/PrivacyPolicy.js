                  possible, on these forms we indicate which fields are required
                  and which fields are optional. In addition, as you use the

                  Anonymized Aggregated Data. We aggregate and anonymize data
                  and use and disclose such information for a variety of

                  End Users. We may share with our Users data regarding usage by

                  User with information about what web page the End User visited
                  before coming to their Portfolios and how their End Users
                  interacted with their Portfolios. This is so Users can analyze
                  the usage of their Portfolios and improve their services.

                  use the services of third-party hosting companies to host the
                  operation of the Application. This may involve the hosting of
                  data, including personal information, on servers operated by
                  those hosting companies. We also partner with third party
                  publishers, advertising networks and service providers to
                  manage our ads on other sites. Our third party partners may

                  about your activities on the Services and other sites you

                  if you visit Ideaform and also use a social media platform,
                  you may see a Ideaform ad in your social media newsfeed or

                  transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100%
                  secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal
                  information, we cannot warrant the security of any information
                  you transmit to us.

                  <strong>How We Retain Your Personal Information</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                  We retain personal information regarding you or your use of
                  the Services for as long as your Account is active or for as
                  long as needed to provide you or our Users with the Services.
                  We also retain personal information for as long as necessary
                  to achieve the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, for
                  example, to comply with our legal obligations, to protect us
                  in the event of disputes and to enforce our agreements and to
                  protect our and others’ interests.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The precise periods for which we keep your personal
                  information vary depending on the nature of the information
                  and why we need it. Factors we consider in determining these
                  periods include the minimum required retention period
                  prescribed by law or recommended as best practice, the period
                  during which a claim can be made with respect to an agreement
                  or other matter, whether the personal information has been
                  aggregated or pseudonymized, and other relevant criteria. For
                  example, the period we keep your email address is connected to
                  how long your Account is active, while the period for which we
                  keep a support message is based on how long has passed since
                  the last submission in the thread.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As Users may come back to us after an Account becomes
                  inactive, we don’t immediately delete your personal
                  information when a trial period expires or you cancel all paid
                  Services. Instead, we keep your personal information for a
                  reasonable period of time, so it will be there for you if you
                  come back.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You may delete your Account by contacting us at{" "}
                  <a href="mailto:contact@reversethought.com">

                  </a>{" "}
                  and we will delete the personal information it holds about you
                  (unless we need to retain it for the purposes set out in this
                  Privacy Policy).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Please note that in the course of providing the Services, we
                  collect and maintain aggregated, anonymized or de-personalized
                  information which we may retain indefinitely.

                  Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy,
                  this document only addresses the use and disclosure of

                  disclose your information to other parties through the

                  may apply to their use, collection and disclosure of the
                  personal information you disclose to them. Since we do not
                  control the information use, collection or disclosure policies
                  of third parties, you are subject to their privacy policies.

                  Users who have created a Portfolio using the Services are
                  responsible for what they do with the personal information
                  they collect, directly or through our Services, about their
                  End Users. This section is directed to our Users concerning

                <p>a. Your Relationship with End Users</p>
                <p>
                  If you’re one of our Users, you may collect personal
                  information about your End Users. For example, during an
                  eCommerce checkout you may ask your End Users to provide their
                  name, address, email address and payment information so that
                  you can complete their orders. You may also use cookies and
                  similar technologies to analyze usage and other trends.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You’re solely responsible for complying with any laws and
                  regulations that apply to your collection and use of your End
                  Users’ information, including personal information you collect
                  about them from us or using our functionality or cookies or

                </p>
                <p>
                  You must publish your own privacy and cookie policy and comply
                  with them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We’re not liable for your relationship with your End Users or
                  how you collect and use personal information about them (even
                  if you collect it from us or using our functionality or
                  cookies or similar technologies) and we won’t provide you with
                  any legal advice regarding such matters.

                <p>b. End User Payment Information</p>
                <p>
                  Your End Users’ payment information may be processed via third
                  party eCommerce Payment Processors with which you integrate
                  your Account, in accordance with such eCommerce Payment
                  Processors’ terms and policies. We transmit your End Users’
                  complete payment information when they initially provide or
                  update it only so that we can pass it along to the eCommerce
                  Payment Processors you agree to use. We don’t collect or store
                  your End Users’ payment information except as described above.
